<p>The Singapore Gardeners’ Cup, a friendly challenge for local community
gardening groups to co-create thematic garden displays and now into its
seventh edition, will also be back at the Festival. Gardening groups from
the five districts in Singapore will partner staff from NParks, landscape
architects, and implementing partners to develop one show garden for each
district. This year’s theme is ‘Botanical Fun’ and will feature a variety
of tropical plants with an emphasis on sustainability.&nbsp;</p>
