third_nav_title: Floral Windows to the World
---
<p>Floral Windows to the World has always been a key highlight of SGF since
the first edition held in 2006, showcasing colourful and creatively cut
flower displays. At SGF 2024, Floral Windows to the World will adopt a
fresh concept and renamed Floral Windows to the World Championship.</p>
<p>Audience members can look forward to a live competition element during
the first three days of the Festival from 3 to 5 August 2024 when designers
will execute a series of six tasks live in front of judges and visitors
to create their masterpieces, with the aim of becoming the Grand Champion.
This refreshed format differs from previous editions of the competition
in which each designer only put up one window installation, and the displays
were completed over four to five days prior to the start of SGF for judging.</p>
<p>A total of 16 floral designers, hailing from 16 countries across five
continents, will compete in the Championship.</p>
<p>The Championship is divided into three parts: Heats (16 competitors),
Semi-Final (10 competitors) and the Grand Final (five competitors). The
top five finalists will compete at a ticketed dinner event* where the Grand
Champion will be crowned.</p>
<p><em>* Note: A ticket to the Championship finals dinner is required to attend and watch the Grand Final.
