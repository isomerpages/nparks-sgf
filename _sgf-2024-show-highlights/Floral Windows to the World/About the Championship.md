---
<p>Floral Windows to the World has always been a key highlight of SGF since
the first edition held in 2006, showcasing colourful and creatively cut
flower displays. At SGF 2024, Floral Windows to the World will adopt a
fresh and different concept and will be renamed Floral Windows to the World
Championship.</p>
<p>Audience members can look forward to a live competition element during
the first three days of the Festival from 3 to 5 August 2024 when designers
will execute a series of six tasks live in front of judges and visitors
to create their masterpieces, with the aim of becoming the Grand Champion.</p>
<p>A total of 18 shortlisted floral designers, hailing from 18 countries
across five continents, will compete in the Championship.</p>
<p>The Championship is divided into three parts: Heats (18 competitors),
Semi-Final (10 competitors) and the Grand Final (five competitors). The
top five finalists will compete at a ticketed dinner event* where the Grand
Champion will be crowned.</p>
<p><em>* Note: A ticket to the Championship finals dinner is required to attend and watch the Grand Final.
