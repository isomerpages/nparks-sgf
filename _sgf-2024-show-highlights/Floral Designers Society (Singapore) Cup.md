<p>The International FDSS Cup - Floral Designing Competition is a prestigious
competition staged by the Floral Designers Society (Singapore) since 1998,
committed to upholding the highest level of floristry standards without
compromise, and promoting floral designing as a recognised profession.
This year, we are excited to present the competition for the 13th time,
in conjunction with the Singapore Garden Festival 2024.</p>
<p>The LIVE competition returns with a fresh new look and revamped format.
The theme, “Designing &amp; Sustainability in Floristry,” incorporates
the 3Rs of Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle into the design tasks.</p>
<p>The competition takes place on Wednesday, 7 August 2024, at Suntec Singapore,
Level 4, with designs displayed daily until 10 pm through 11 August 2024.</p>
<p>Both local and international floral art designers who meet specific entry
requirements are welcome to register by 15 May 2024. Participants will
rise to the challenge to have their works assessed by a distinguished panel
of international floral designers and stand a chance to win attractive
cash prizes, trophies, and recognition certificates.</p>
