<p>Floral Windows to the World has always been a key highlight of SGF since
the first edition held in 2006. It showcases colourful and creatively cut
flower displays, complemented by stunning set design and lighting. Visitors
to the Show admire the enchanting displays of beautiful flowers, creatively
and delicately designed by celebrated local and international floral designers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At SGF 2024, Floral Windows to the World will adopt a fresh and different
concept and will be renamed Floral Windows to the World Championship. For
this new edition, the National Parks Board is calling for international
floral designers to compete in the Championship. Interested floral designers
are welcome to submit their application by 22 March 2024, Friday. For more
information, you may download the competition kit <a href="/files/SGF2024_Floral_Windows_to_the_World_Championship_Registration_Kit.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
