1. What is Singapore Garden Festival?
		Singapore Garden Festival (SGF) is a biennial event, positioned to be amongst the top flower and garden shows on the international calendar. SGF is the first show to bring together top international award-winning landscape and garden designers, florists and horticulturists from around the world, who are invited to the Festival to work alongside Singapore's own talented horticulturists. Singapore's geographic location makes the Festival an ideal platform to showcase horticultural and gardening products and services from the northern and southern hemispheres, as well as from Asia and New World nations.

5. Are dogs allowed to Singapore Garden Festival at Gardens by the Bay?


	Gardens by the Bay allows dogs on leash at the Outdoor Gardens, but not at the Conservatories, OCBC Skyway and the Children's Garden (with the exception of guide dogs). Similarly for the Festival, with the exception of guide dogs, pets/animals in general are not permitted due to the displays and set up that we have. We seek your understanding in this.
