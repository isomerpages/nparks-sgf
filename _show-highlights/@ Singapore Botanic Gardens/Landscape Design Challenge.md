The Landscape Design Challenge (LDC) is a landscaping and design-based competition for students from the Institutes of Higher Learning. Held as part of the Singapore Garden Festival, the competition provides a platform for students to enhance their learning experience.

This year’s theme of “Botanical Fantasy” will stretch the imagination of the students.

We are excited to welcome back ITE College East, Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, and Singapore Polytechnic. In addition, we have a new team from Republic Polytechnic stepping into the competition arena. The top team stands to win $2,400 of shopping vouchers!
