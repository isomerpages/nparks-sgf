Be dazzled by brilliant blooms in different hues and colours at the Gardenersâ€™ Cup 2018!
More than 200 Community in Bloom (CIB) gardeners from over 60 CIB groups across the
island have come together to create beautiful show gardens featuring plant families such as
Apocynaceae, Malvaceae, Rubiaceae, Rosaceae and Zingiberales. Come admire the many
intricacies in the world of flowers and foliage, and enjoy the splendour of these five
community gardens.
Our CIB gardeners will also display do-it-yourself garden decorations which can be easily
replicated in home gardens. Be amazed by the fusion of horticultural skill with art and
discover the innovative techniques used by community gardeners to accentuate their
gardens designs.
Take this opportunity to meet your friendly community gardeners and pick up tips on how to
grow some of your favourite plants in your own home garden. Come and be inspired today!
