Immerse yourself in an enchanting world of whimsy and wonder at the Singapore Gardeners’ Cup (SGC) 2022! After a hiatus of two years, the SGC is back to celebrate the community gardening spirit as we emerge stronger and more resilient after the pandemic. Held in conjunction with the Singapore Garden Festival (SGF) since 2010, the SGC is a collaborative and friendly competition for local community gardeners, aimed at nurturing a flourishing gardening culture across Singapore. Our Community in Bloom (CIB) gardeners from 40 gardening groups have come together with industry partners to create a Gardeners’ Fantasia of five beautiful garden displays showcasing various aspects of a City in Nature. Come and have a charming time in the garden with us!
