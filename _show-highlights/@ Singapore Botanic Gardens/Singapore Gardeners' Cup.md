Immerse yourself in an enchanting world of whimsy and wonder at the Singapore Gardeners’ Cup (SGC) 2022! As we emerge stronger and more resilient after the pandemic, the SGC is back to celebrate the community gardening spirit. Held in conjunction with the Singapore Garden Festival (SGF) since 2010, the SGC is a collaborative and friendly competition for local community gardeners, aimed at nurturing a flourishing gardening culture across Singapore. More than 200 Community in Bloom (CIB) gardeners from 40 CIB groups have come together with NParks and landscape industry partners to create a Gardeners’ Fantasia of 5 beautiful garden displays showcasing various aspects of a City in Nature. 
Come and have a charming time in the garden with us!
