<p><strong>Singapore, 5 August 2024 - </strong>Ahti Lyra from Estonia has
clinched the top award of Grand Champion at the Floral Windows to the World
Championship (FWWC) as part of Singapore Garden Festival (SGF) 2024. This
is the first time a designer from Estonia has participated in SGF. Also
receiving their accolades from Guest of Honour, Ms Chang Hwee Nee, CEO
of National Heritage Board, at the award ceremony earlier today are Hung
Mo Joo, Momo from Republic of Korea and Hiroto Inoue from Japan, who won
the first and second runner-ups respectively.</p>
<p>The competition returned in a refreshed live format for the first time
after a six-year hiatus and took place between 3 and 5 August 2024, at
Suntec Singapore Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre. This year’s FWWC featured
16 competitors from around the world competing against each other in a
series of six live tasks in front of judges and visitors. Each competitor
has a minimum of five years of experience in the floral industry or in
various international floral competitions.</p>
<p>The refreshed FWWC was judged by renowned international floral designers:</p>

</ul>
<p>Mrs Alison Bradley, Head Judge for FWWC and Director and Co-Founder of
Floral Fundamentals, commented on the quality of the participants this
year: “The refreshed format takes on a different challenge and creates
excitement for both designers and visitors. The quality of the displays
created under time pressure has been superb. The surprise tasks for this
competition are world-class and have broken new boundaries.” An award-winning
creative floral designer herself, Mrs Bradley was also a judge at the Floral
Windows to the World editions in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The themes of the tasks ranged from “Designer’s Choice” and “Bridal Bouquet”
to “Table for Two”, challenging the designers on their versatility and
adaptability. The final three tasks were surprise packages, “Unexpected
Host”, “A Gift for Singapore” and “Blossoming Finale”.</p>
<p>The Grand Champion in the competition, Ahti Lyra from Estonia, shared
that, “For the competition, I thought hard about how to share my culture,
representing my country of 1.3 million people, and what would be interesting
for Singaporeans to see. My inspiration ranged from nature to Estonian
smoke saunas and black bread.” Ahti shared this as advice for floral designers,
“work hard and compete not for the judges, but for yourself.”</p>
