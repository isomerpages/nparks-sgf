<p><strong>‘ENGARDENING’ BY LOCAL GARDEN DESIGNER, ANN TEO REIMAGINES A TROPICAL GARDEN WITH EDIBLE LANDSCAPES</strong>
</p>
<p>‘Engardening’ captured the attention of visitors and received the People’s
Choice Award. The tropical garden pays homage to the allure of living gardens,
where ornamental and edible plants, whether native or naturalised, contribute
to a vibrant tapestry, transcending their utilitarian purpose to become
expressions of form, beauty and hope.</p>
<p>A total of 39 displays were in the running for the People’s Choice Award.
These included competitive garden and floral displays created by professional
international and local designers across the Best of Show Designer Gardens
Competition and Balcony Gardens Competition, as well as Floral Windows
to the World Championship at Level 6 and the Floral Table-Top Competition
at Level 4.</p>

<p>Community Gardeners from the South West District showcased their artistry
through their ‘Botanical Kaleidoscope’ garden and emerged as the community’s
hot favourite. The garden captivates with a kaleidoscope dome housing lush
tropical plant, handcrafted butterfly sculptures made from upcycled materials
and plants nurtured by the community gardeners.</p>
<p>The votes for the Community’s Choice Award were for the displays located
at Level 4 (apart from Floral-Table Top displays, which was part of the
People’s Choice voting). This category celebrates the efforts from the
community and industry in contributing to the displays at SGF.</p>
<p>For each of the Awards, one lucky voter walked away with a two-night stay
at Pan Pacific Singapore. Winners will be notified via their mobile numbers
to collect their prizes.</p>
