**SINGAPORE, 30 July 2022 –** Singapore Garden Festival (SGF) opens to the public today with its eighth edition, after a four-year hiatus, with a variety of displays and exhibits at two new locations along Orchard Road – ION Orchard and Ngee Ann City – which includes non-competitive floral installations by local award-winning floral designers and the all-time favourite Show Garden Competition entries. Members of the public can also look forward to its Singapore Botanic Gardens segment that offers a wide range of community-led displays and competitions. Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for National Development and Minister-in-Charge of Social Services Integration officially opened the Festival as well as gave out the awards for the Orchid Competition.

Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration Mr Desmond Lee said: “I am thrilled to see the Singapore Garden Festival buzzing again after a four-year hiatus with award-winning plants and landscape displays, showcasing both horticultural know-how and artistry. I thank the gardeners, competitors and landscape designers for sharing their talent and vision with us, as well as the volunteers for their time and effort in making the festival possible. We hope that the return of the festival to new locations at Orchard Road and Singapore Botanic Gardens will bring the Festival closer to the community. This will provide more opportunities for all of us to nurture an appreciation for gardening and greenery as we transform Singapore into a City in Nature.”

**Competitions showcasing creativity from the community**

The popular competition Singapore Gardeners’ Cup returns this year with five garden displays put together by 40 Community in Bloom (CIB) gardening groups. Themed “Gardeners’ Fantasia”, each display features various aspects of what a _City in Nature_ means to each group, through landscape design, plant choices, storytelling or the use of repurposed materials. The Singapore Gardeners’ Cup is supported by donors through NParks’ registered charity, Garden City Fund. These displays are located at Eco-Garden at the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Winners will be announced later today at 2pm.

Also located at the Eco-Garden are the 10 displays as part of the Landscape Design Challenge (LDC), a design-based competition that showcases landscaping done by students from Institutes of Higher Learning in Singapore. A platform for students to display their creativity and landscaping knowledge, the competition takes place “live” where students were given four hours to transform a plot of land 3-metres by 3-metres into a beautifully decorated garden.

This year’s competition features the theme “Botanical Fantasy” and winners will be announced later today at 4pm. The competition aims to encourage more youths to consider a career in the landscape industry by highlighting the professionalism of the work as well as simulating an actual work environment to help students put classroom learning into practice.

**Floral artistry by the community at ION Orchard**

Members of the public visiting the Orchard Road segment of the Festival must not miss the live floral competitions and its exhibits at ION Orchard (Basement 4). Taking place live today is the Floral Designers Society (Singapore) \[FDSS\] Competition featuring 10 professional and 16 amateur florists who are putting their floral displays together in real time. The winners will be announced this evening and the floral pieces will be on display till 2 August.

This is followed by a new mass live floral competition organised by NParks at the same location – the Floral Fiesta: A Floral Creation Challenge. 60 individuals have signed up for this competition, which will see them participating in three rounds of live competition from 6pm to 8pm between 3 to 5 August. Winners will be announced on 5 August and the floral pieces will be on display on 6 and 7 August.
