<p>-<em>National Parks Board announces anticipated return of Festival with a Prelude and showcase at Takashimaya Square</em>
<br><em>-This year’s Festival will coincide with Singapore hosting the 8th Global Botanic Gardens Congress, to be held for the first time in Southeast Asia</em>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Garden Festival (SGF) will be returning for its ninth edition
at Suntec Singapore Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre in August this year.
Organised by the National Parks Board (NParks), the premier international
garden and flower show will bring back familiar favourites such as the
Best of Show Designer Gardens competition and a refreshed Floral Windows
to the World Championship, which both feature award-winning designers from
all around the world. The Balcony Gardens competition and Floral Table-Top
competition, with local designers, will also be making a comeback, alongside
the Singapore Gardeners’ Cup celebrating community gardeners islandwide.
These signature highlights along with the repertoire of participating designers
for the Best of Show Designer Gardens competition were announced today,
at an event at Takashimaya Square as a prelude to the Festival that is
returning to an indoor venue for the first time since 2012.
<br>
<br><strong><u>SGF Prelude (14-17 March 2024) at Takashimaya Square</u></strong>
<br>The SGF Prelude event runs from 14 – 17 March 2024, at Takashimaya Square
B2 and is free to attend. It kickstarts ticket sales for SGF in August
and offers a glimpse of the floral displays and programmes that will be
on show at SGF. At the Prelude, visitors can purchase discounted tickets
to the Festival.
<br>
<br>Visitors to the Prelude event will be treated to a showcase of 24 floral
displays by Ikebana florists from the Ikebana International Singapore Chapter
135, the largest number of Ikebana displays at SGF to date. The unique
Ikebana creations incorporate edibles – from fresh vegetables such as cauliflower,
chilli, green pepper, and long beans, to pandan and dried edibles like
corn and lemon.
<br>
<br>An orchid display featuring various celebrity and heritage orchids are
also on showcase, including <em>Dendrobium</em> hybrids named after Bae Yong
Jun, Serena Williams, and Stephanie Sun, as well as <em>Aranda</em> Noorah
Alsagoff, one of the most well-known blue arandas, and <em>Aranda</em> Grandeur
which has impressive large blooms with pink colour shading. The Prelude
event also features 10 MarketPlace booths where gardening enthusiasts and
plant lovers can purchase their choice plants and other lifestyle products,
as well as participate in free floral workshops over the weekend.
<br>
<br>A highlight of the Prelude is the “live” Floral Fiesta competition on
15 March 2024. The competition will feature two rounds of exciting live
action during which participants will pick from an assortment of flowers
to create their floral masterpieces. The top five finalists will be announced
tomorrow evening and move on to compete in the Floral Table-Top competition
as part of the main show in August.

<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>SGF (3-11 August 2024) at Suntec Singapore: A horticultural and floral treat by international and local designers</u></strong>
<br>This year’s SGF will be held at Suntec Singapore Convention &amp; Exhibition
Centre, Levels 4 and 6, from 3 – 11 August 2024. The show will present
landscape and floral creations from award-winning international and local
designers, community gardeners and plant enthusiasts, offering a visual
feast for all visitors.
<br>
<br>Dennis Lim, Coordinating Director, Festivals, Events and Exhibitions at
NParks said, “We look forward to welcoming local and international visitors
at the first full-scale SGF post-pandemic and introducing an exciting new
competition format through the Floral Windows to the World Championship.
From spectacular gardens and enchanting floral displays to the wide array
of community showcase including wearable floral art, bonsai and Ikebana
arrangements, our goal is to provide a delightful and memorable experience
for everyone at SGF 2024.”
<br>
<br>The Best of Show Designer Gardens competition will feature 12 Landscape
Gardens and Fantasy Gardens, where designers will be paired with local
Implementing Partners to execute their display. Returning to defend their
2022 Gold Award, “Best of Show” and “Best Construction” titles, uncle and
nephew designer duo from Singapore, Eliam Eng and Andy Eng, will be participating
in the Landscape Garden category.
<br>
<br>Other returning past SGF Gold medalists include Kazuyuki Ishihara (Japan;
Gold and Best of Show at SGF 2008), Leon Kluge (South Africa; Gold and
Best of Show at SGF 2018), and Mark Cook and Emily Cook (United States
of America; Gold at SGF 2018). The Republic of Korea (ROK) and Thailand
will be represented in this competition for the first time, with designers
Hwang Ji-Hae from ROK and Sanitas Pradittasnee from Thailand.
<br>
<br>The Floral Windows to the World Championship will feature a new competition
format for the first time in SGF’s history, when 18 international floral
designers representing 18 respective countries will be vying for the title
of Grand Champion through executing six challenging tasks over three days.
These tasks will be carried out in front of live audiences throughout the
Festival, culminating in a final show-down with five finalists.
<br>
<br>In addition to the Floral Table-Top competition that will feature finalists
from the Floral Fiesta competition, our homegrown talents will have their
chance to shine in the Balcony Gardens competition. The competition, which
is making a return after the last edition in 2021, will offer inspiration
for apartment dwellers on incorporating greenery into their homes and transforming
their balconies into soothing retreats for the senses.
<br>
<br>The Singapore Gardeners’ Cup, a friendly challenge for local community
gardening groups to co-create thematic garden displays and now into its
seventh edition, will also be back at the Festival. Gardening groups from
the five districts in Singapore will partner staff from NParks, landscape
architects, and implementing partners to develop one show garden for each
district. This year’s theme is ‘Botanical Fun’ and will feature a variety
of tropical plants with an emphasis on sustainability.&nbsp;

<p><strong>SGF 2024 to coincide with prestigious Global Botanic Gardens Congress</strong>
<br>This year’s Festival will coincide with the 8th Global Botanic Gardens
Congress which will also be held at Suntec Singapore Convention &amp; Exhibition
Centre from 6 to 9 August 2024. This will be the <strong><u>first</u></strong> time
the Congress is held in Southeast Asia and it is jointly organised by the
Singapore Botanic Gardens and Botanic Gardens Conservation International.
<br>
<br>The Global Botanic Garden Congress is the only global congress dedicated
to botanic gardens. It is a key event and opportunity for the botanic garden
community to come together and share information and experiences. Held
every three or four years, the Congress includes internationally renowned
plenary speakers and sessions covering topics on key activities of botanic
gardens in species conservation, research, education and outreach, conservation
horticulture, plant collections curation, and many more.
<br>
<br>With the theme this year being “Botanic Gardens: People and Plants for
a Sustainable Future”, the Congress will feature engaging presentations
by global thought leaders, workshops, panel discussions, and technical
tours. It aims to galvanise collective action for botanic gardens to fulfil
their missions in research, conservation, education and outreach, and contribute
to addressing global issues of the climate crisis and biodiversity loss.
The public can learn more about the Congress and register for it at <a href="https://sgf.nparks.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.8gbgc.sbg.org.sg</a>.</p>
