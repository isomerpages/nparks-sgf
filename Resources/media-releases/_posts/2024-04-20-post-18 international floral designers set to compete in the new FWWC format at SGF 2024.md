<p><strong><em>18 international floral designers set to compete in the new Floral Windows to the World Championship format at Singapore Garden Festival 2024</em></strong>
</p>
<p>-&nbsp;<em>National Parks Board rolls out a new format after a six-year hiatus of this competition</em> 
<br>-&nbsp;<em>The Championship will feature a new live competition element and a record number of 18 international floral designers vying for the Grand Champion title</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Singapore, 20 April 2024 </strong>– The National Parks Board (NParks)
announced the 18 designers who will be participating in the <strong>Floral Windows to the World Championship (FWWC)</strong>.
This is a refreshed format of Floral Windows to the World, which has been
part of the Singapore Garden Festival (SGF), the premier international
garden and flower show. This year, the competition features a record number
of 18 designers, with 13 of them participating in SGF for the first time.
SGF will be held at Suntec Singapore Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre
from 3 to 11 August 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Refreshed Championship format to engage Festival visitors with exciting live competition element</strong>
</p>
<p>The Floral Windows to the World competition takes on a new Championship
format as it returns after a six-year hiatus <sup>[1]</sup>. Audience members
can look forward to a <strong>live competition element</strong> during the
first three days of the Festival from 3 to 5 August 2024 when designers
will execute a series of six tasks in front of judges and visitors to create
their masterpieces from scratch, competing for the title of Grand Champion.
This refreshed format differs from previous editions of the competition
in which each designer only put up one window installation, and the displays
were completed over four to five days prior to the start of SGF for judging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year’s FWWC is open to all international professional floral designers
with a minimum of five years of experience in the floral industry or experience
competing in international floral competitions. A total of 17 international
designers and one local designer from Singapore have been selected to compete,
representing 18 countries across five continents (Africa, the Americas,
Asia, Europe, and Oceania). This is a significant increase compared to
the previous seven iterations which had nine to 11 international designers
in each edition. This increase in the number of international designers
brings more diversity to the competition as they each present their unique
style of floral design. For the first time, there will also be designers
from Estonia, Hungary and Poland participating in SGF, adding to the rich
repertoire of international designers that will be showcasing their floral
and landscape skills.</p>
<p>“We are excited for this upcoming edition of FWWC”, said Alison Bradley,
Director and Co-Founder of Floral Fundamentals, Head Judge for FWWC. “The
refreshed format will challenge the designers and showcase their ability
to create beautiful arrangements in front of a live audience. The competitors
and viewing public alike are in for a few surprises and the new expanded
judging team cannot wait to see the results.”</p>
<p>Dennis Lim, Coordinating Director, Festivals, Events and Exhibitions at
NParks said, “Over the years we have introduced new highlights to keep
the Festival fresh for our visitors. We reviewed competition formats from
around the world and wanted to insert a more interactive element where
visitors and florists can learn techniques from designers as they compete
live. We are happy to present this new, exciting format of FWWC that is
akin to the ‘Olympics of floral competitions’ and is poised to be one of
the top international floral design competitions. The strong line-up of
designers from 18 countries are all eager to present their best creations
and emerge top in this Championship, to make their country proud. We look
forward to providing visitors with a visual feast and memorable experience
at SGF 2024.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>All visitors to SGF can watch the live competition for FWWC. The top five
finalists will compete at a ticketed dinner event on the final day of the
competition (5 August), where the Grand Champion will be crowned. A ticket
to the Championship finals dinner is required to attend and watch the finals
(Task 6). Tickets for SGF 2024 and the Championship finals dinner can be
