*Showcase of tropical horticultural excellence to be held at the new Jurong Lake Gardens*

 
The well-loved Singapore Garden Festival (SGF) will make its return in 2019 with the inaugural SGF Horticulture Show in April. Organised by the National Parks Board (NParks), this follows the seventh edition of Asia’s premier tropical floral and garden show, which saw a record of more than 600,000 local and international visitors in 2018.

Mr Dennis Lim, Director (Festival, Events & Exhibitions), NParks, said, “With the main Festival already a widely recognised name in the international arena, we are excited about presenting more opportunities for local and international visitors to appreciate and be inspired by tropical horticulture in Singapore every year. The SGF Horticulture Show will provide a new platform for Singaporeans to cultivate their love for greening and join us in co-creating our City in a Garden.”

 

**SGF Horticulture Show a showcase of excellence**

The SGF Horticulture Show is set to wow visitors with outstanding horticultural displays from 27 April to 5 May 2019 and admission will be free. The nine-day event will take place once every two years and aims to nurture interest in horticulture and provide an opportunity for local industry partners to demonstrate their expertise, while students and community gardeners hone their skills.

To be held in the upcoming Jurong Lake Gardens, the SGF Horticulture Show will feature competitive and non-competitive elements to appeal to varying interests.

A new Horticultural Competition will provide an avenue for plant enthusiasts and growers alike to showcase their horticulture skills across nine categories. Amateurs and professionals can submit their aroids, begonias, bromeliads, carnivorous plants, edible plants, ferns, flowering plants, gesneriads and succulents to compete for the challenge cup and medals. Submissions for the competition are open now until 25 April 2019 (Thursday). More information is available at https://www.singaporegardenfestival.com/SGF-Hort-Show/Show-Info.

Other key competitions include the Vertical Greenery Competition where innovative vertical garden installations based on the theme of “Into the next dimension” will offer refreshing approaches for Singapore’s urban landscaping. Not to be missed is the new Aquascape Display and Competition where visitors can feast their eyes on beautiful underwater garden landscapes for the first time. With more than 100 terrariums by students and community gardeners, My Mini Eden will showcase how gardening can be done indoors with limited space and inspire aspiring green thumbs to take greater interest in greening – even the exhibition area will be transformed into a larger-than-life terrarium!

Non-competitive events will also captivate all who visit the show. The magical world of Miniature Settings will see local talents from NParks and various Institutes of Higher Learning tell a myriad of stories through scaled dioramas filled with plants. Separately, Beautiful Bonsai will showcase eye-catching bonsai specimens from Jurong Lake Gardens, local bonsai collectors and nurseries, with some dating back to 1712.

Complementing the horticultural displays, the popular SGF Marketplace will make its return, offering plants, gardening and horticultural products, as well as food and drinks.

While the nine-day SGF Hort Show opens from 10am to 7pm, visitors can also look forward to weekend performances at Jurong Lake Gardens even after the Show closes in the evenings.

 

**SGF Orchid Show returns in December 2019**

To round off 2019, SGF Orchid Show will hold its second edition from 7 to 15 December 2019.

During the biennial event, floral enthusiasts can admire orchid landscape displays and award-winning orchid plants showcased at the National Orchid Garden and other parts of the Singapore Botanic Gardens.

Admission to both the SGF Horticulture and Orchid Shows will be free. More details are available at [www.singaporegardenfestival.com]() and [www.facebook.com/SGGardenFest](www.facebook.com/SGGardenFest).
