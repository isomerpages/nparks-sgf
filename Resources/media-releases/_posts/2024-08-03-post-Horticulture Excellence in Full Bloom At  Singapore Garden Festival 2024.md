Best of Show Designer Gardens Competition.
<br>
<br>This year, there are also six returning Gold winners who are here to defend

garden design. The quality of this year's displays where tropical plants
take the spotlight, is outstanding and incredibly high - a true testament
to the high horticulture standards upheld by the Festival.”

<p><strong>Botanical display by the Singapore Botanic Gardens to celebrate the spirit of community and beauty of the tropics</strong>
</p>
<p>Greeting visitors as the entrance display on Level 6, the Tropical Oasis
display celebrates the spirit of community and beauty of nature in tropical
Singapore. Visitors will see our native species that made a comeback through
our collective conservation efforts, including the Oriental Pied Hornbill
(<em>Anthracoceros albirostris</em>) and Smooth-coated Otters (<em>Lutrogale perspicillata</em>),
living amongst lush native tropical trees such as the Neram tree (<em>Dipterocarpus oblongifolius</em>),
flowing stream, and spectacular flowers.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Oasis, a tree house surrounded by edible plants such
as Basil (<em>Oncimum basilicum</em>) hints at human inhabitation, part
of the community living in harmony with nature. Charming blooms including
our national flower – Vanda Miss Joaquim (<em>Papilionanthe</em> Miss Joaquim)
– and native trees such as the <em>Kopsia singapurensis, </em>a free flowering
tree featuring white flowers with a red dot much like Singapore,<em> </em>and
Sembawang tree (<em>Kayea ferruginea</em>), one of many native plants that
inspired the names of areas in Singapore, illustrate our close ties with
nature. This intertwined relationship reveals nature as an inspiration,
as Singapore continues its journey towards the City in Nature vision.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore Garden Festival aims to foster appreciation for nature and gardening in the community</strong>
</p>
<p>Besides being a celebration of floral artistry and horticulture excellence,
the Festival also champions various community engagement initiatives to
encourage greater community appreciation for nature and participation in
making Singapore our City in Nature. &nbsp;It is a platform for partners,
students, and community gardeners to showcase their fruits of labour, fostering
a sense of pride and ownership in shared green spaces.</p>
<p>The Singapore Gardeners’ Cup, a friendly challenge for local community
gardening groups, is now in its seventh edition this year. Visitors can
look forward to thematic show gardens on Level 4 based on the theme “Botanical
Fun”.</p>
<p>From spectacular gardens and enchanting floral displays to the wide array
of community showcase including wearable floral art, bonsai and Ikebana
arrangements, and a botanical-themed photography exhibition, SGF 2024 is
set to dazzle from 3 to 11 August at Suntec Singapore Convention &amp;
Exhibition Centre (Level 4 and 6). Other favourites not to be missed include
the MarketPlace and a series of talks, floristry demonstrations and workshops.
A crowd favourite at SGF, the MarketPlace has over 70 retailers offering
plants, gardening-related and lifestyle products, and arts and crafts for
sale. This includes close to 30 overseas retailers from places including
Ecuador, Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand offering a wide array of products.</p>
