The Landscape Design Challenge (LDC) is a landscaping and design-based competition for students from local Institutes of Higher Learning. Held as part of the Singapore Garden Festival, the competition provides a platform for students to enhance their learning experience. Participants for this year’s competition include students from ITE College East, Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Nanyang Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore Polytechnic and Temasek Polytechnic. Teams have to work on the theme of ‘Kaleidoscope of Colours’, drawing on their landscape design knowledge and creativity to transform a nine-square-metre plot into an outdoor landscape display within four hours.

With support from industry partners such as the Singapore Institute of Landscape Architects (SILA), Landscape Industry Association of Singapore (LIAS) and plant nurseries in Singapore, this competition aims to provide students with the opportunity to showcase their landscape design and implementation capabilities. As part of efforts to provide a more holistic experience in the lead-up to the competition, the students also participated in workshops conducted by the National Parks Board and leading industry practitioners.
