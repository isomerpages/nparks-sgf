Singapore Garden Festival (SGF) is a biennial event, recognised as one of the top flower and garden shows on the international calendar. Under its umbrella are two other offshoots – SGF Orchid Show and SGF Horticulture Show.

This year’s SGF Hort Show will run from 9 to 31 October 2021, with a wide array of online activities this year, including a variety of talks and demonstrations as well as an e-marketplace to enable members of the public to shop from the comfort of their homes. Photos and videos of the winning competition plants will also be hosted on this webpage for you to appreciate their beauty.
